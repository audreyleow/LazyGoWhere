# LazyGoWhere

This is a responsive full-stack web application I wrote for a school software engineering project that allows users to create personalised or auto-generated itineraries for activities in Singapore

- I also integrated firebase authentication that allows users to persist their itinerary preferences by tagging it to their Google account.

*This was written using React, Express and MongoDB. If you would like to see an application demo, please contact me directly.*
